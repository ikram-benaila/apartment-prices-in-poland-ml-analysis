This project aims to predict apartment prices in Poland using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains several key features related to the properties, including:

1-City: The name of the city where the property is located.

2-Type: Type of building (e.g., residential, commercial).

3-Square Meters: The size of the apartment in square meters.

4-Rooms: The number of rooms in the apartment.

5-Floor/Floor Count: The floor of the apartment and the total number of floors in the building.

6-Build Year: The year the building was constructed.

7-Latitude/Longitude: The geographical coordinates of the property.

8-Centre Distance: The distance from the city center.

9-POI Count: The number of points of interest (schools, clinics, restaurants, etc.) within a 500m range.

10-[POI Name] Distance: Distance to specific points of interest such as schools, pharmacies, and restaurants.

Using this data, various machine learning models will be trained to predict the prices of apartments based on these features. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation to find the best predictive model for accurate apartment price predictions.
